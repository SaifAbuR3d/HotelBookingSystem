# HotelBookingAPI üè®üîëüåê

This API offers a suite of endpoints for managing hotel-related activities. It allows for handling bookings, managing hotel and city information, and providing guest services.
Developed during my internship at Foothill Technology Solutions, This project represents not only a technical endeavor but also a personal journey of professional growth and learning. By integrating modern software development practices and technologies, the HotelBookingAPI stands as a testament to the practical application of theoretical knowledge in a real-world setting.

## Tools and Concepts

This section provides an overview of the key tools, technologies, and concepts used in the development and operation of the Hotel Booking System API.

### Programming Languages and Frameworks
- **C#**: Primary programming language used.
- **.NET Core**: Framework for building high-performance, cross-platform web APIs.

### Database
- **Entity Framework Core**: Object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET.
- **SQL Server**: Database management system used for storing all application data.

### API Documentation and Design
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Used for API specification and documentation.
- **Swagger UI**: Provides a web-based UI for interacting with the API's endpoints.

### Authentication and Authorization
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

### Testing
- **xUnit**: Unit testing tool for the C# programming language.
- **Postman**: Tool for API testing and exploring.

### Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Automating workflows including continuous integration.
- **Azure DevOps**: Utilized for continuous delivery and deployment
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and ensuring consistent environments.

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Serilog**: Logging library for .NET applications.
- **Application Insights**: Extensive logging, monitoring, and alerting system.

### Design Patterns and Architectural Concepts
- **RESTful Principles**: A design approach for APIs that use HTTP requests to access and manipulate data.
- **Repository Pattern**: Used for abstracting the data layer, making our application more maintainable, testable, and clean.
- **Options Pattern**: Used for accessing and managing configurations within the application.
- **Clean Architecture**: Organizing the project into four layers:
  - **External Layers**: 
    - Web: Contains Controllers.
    - Infrastructure: Contains Persistence, Email, PDF, and Identity Infrastructure.
  - **Core Layers**:
    - Application: Business logic and application rules. It also defines Abstractions for working with Infrastructure.
    - Domain: Fundamental business rules and entities.

### Security
- **HTTPS**: Ensuring secure communication over the network.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypting sensitive data in the database.

By leveraging these tools and concepts, the Hotel Booking System API aims to provide a robust, scalable, and secure platform for hotel booking management.
